I represent a game instance of the game Lights Out from Pharo by Example.

My main responsibility is to render the game GUI and implement its logic. I know the cells in the game.

I interact with the class LightsOutCell in order to create cells for the game.

You can create an instance of me by calling new:

LightsOutGame new.

    Instance Variables
	cells:		These are the LightsOutCells of the game.
